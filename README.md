# Database Project: Wholesale Management Database
## Inspiration
I used to work for a company based in Atlanta, GA. This company is a wholesaler of furniture and spa chairs. Since this was a small company, I had opportunities to be exposed to different functional departments and learnt a lot on the job. As I was more specialized in operations and inventory management system, I worked with Sales department, warehouse supervisors as well as purchasing department at the same time. However, during the time I was working there, although they have other approaches to store the data, there was no completely consolidated database for all employees to access to. That valuable experience inspired me to work on this personal project - wholesale management database where I created a consolidated and user-friendly database for internal use. 
## Project's aim
To serve the purpose of reducing the human errors and simplifying the data entry process, triggers were utilized to ensure that all the inputs are valid and contributed meaningfully to the database. Whereas, procedures are optimized to minimize efforts and time by automated insert/update. With one procedure, all associated tables can be updated/inserted accordingly. 
## Methodology
MySQL Workbench 8.0
